Stroke Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the occurrence of strokes in patients using machine learning techniques. The prediction model takes into account various features such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status.

The model has been deployed using Streamlit and is hosted on Streamlit Share. You can view the deployment here.

Steps to Achieve a 99% Accuracy
To achieve an optimal solution of predicting strokes with 99% accuracy, the following steps were taken:

Data Collection: Gathered a comprehensive dataset containing information on patients' demographics, medical history, and lifestyle factors.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Feature Engineering: Created new features and transformed existing features to improve the predictive power of the model.

Model Selection: Experimented with different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to find the best model for the task.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the chosen model using techniques like grid search and random search to optimize its performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance.

Deployment: Deployed the final model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application for predicting strokes in real-time.

By following these steps and continuously iterating on the model, we were able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 99%.

Feel free to explore the deployment and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
